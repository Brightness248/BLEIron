**BLEIron** is for makers who want to solder not only through-hole but also SMD components. <br>
There are ready-made solutions, but they are usually expensive or too small or both ^^.<br>
Made from an old iron, an SSR, PC power supply, fan and a MAX6675, you can solder your own boards wonderfully. 
With the help of the self-programmed APP, the desired temperature and soldering time are transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy. Cooling, lighting and a voice output can also be activated. The ACTUAL temperature is displayed in the app. 
The device itself symbolises 3 states via 16 neopixels:<br> 
- blue - BLE device not connected 
- green - BLE connected / ready for operation 
- red - active heating 
<br>

## important note 

This project is still **in development**. <br>
Although everything works in general and I have already soldered several boards, changes in the code may be added or adapted due to improvements or bug fixes.
